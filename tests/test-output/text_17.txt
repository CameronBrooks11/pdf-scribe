moved and bathed in uv light. EPROM is a pretty old stan-
dard, and is not used much any more.

Electrically-erasable PROM (EEPROM) can be rewritten with
only electrical signals. They are cleverly constructed from
transistors with floating gates. EEPROMs allow individual
memory cells to be selectively erased and rewritten. Currently
EEPROMS have relatively small amounts of storage, and are
relatively expensive, but have very long lifetimes.

Most of you are familiar with flash, a form of EEPROM. Flash
is cheaper than EEPROM because it compromises by only
erasing and rewriting data in blocks considerably larger than
one memory cell (512 or more), and having a shorter lifetime
than EEPROM.

Most modern microcontrollers have at least one ROM (usually
Flash) and at least one static RAM on the chip. Additional mem-
ory of any type can be added as a peripheral.

There are several other types of electronic circuit that can be con-
sidered a form of memory, including programmable logic devices
(PLDs) such as programmable array logic (PAL), field-programmable
gate arrays (FPGAs), and configurable logic blocks (CLBs). In fact,
you used the FGPA chip on the DE10-Standard development board
for the lab exercises in ECE2277. We will not discuss these circuits
in this course.
