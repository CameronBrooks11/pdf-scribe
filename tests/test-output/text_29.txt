cares”. We could do a 12-variable K-map if we wanted to... but

it should be pretty clear from the table above that the logic that
determines whether or not an address is within the range accepted by
the RAM chip is just: ?

9 The notation “CSA” is commonly used for
“chip select RAM”, with additional subscripts

CSA = Gj. added for identification if there is more than one
RAM chip.

Similarly, the ROM chip accepts addresses from 0x800 to OxFFF,
giving us the a range in binary of:
Address bit Qa11 Qji9 Ag Ag a7 ag a5 A, AZ Ag A, Ag

Lowest 1 0 0 0 00 00 0 0 0 0
Highest 1 212 2 2213213212 21%21é%1é6421

Equivalent 1 x x x x x xX xX xX xX x x

 

 

Again, all possible values of the 11 lowest-order bits must be ac-
cepted by the ROM chip, so we can replace these with “don’t-cares”.
The logic that determines whether or not an address is within the
range accepted by the ROM chip is just: 1° 10 The notation “CSO” is commonly used for
“chip select ROM”, with additional subscripts
CSO = a1. added for identification if there is more than one
ROM chip.
To summarize:

e We have a system with an n bit address bus and memory
chips that require m address lines.

e We pass the lowest-order m bits to the memory chip, where
they will be used internally to find the particular memory cell.

e We design combinational logic with the remaining (n — m)
highest-order bits to identify when that memory chip should
