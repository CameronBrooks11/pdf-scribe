Branch back to loop if not

The CPU’s job is to fetch these instructions one at a time, perform
that instruction, then advance to the next instruction.

e Typically, the next instruction is literally at the next address in

memory.

e Certain instructions only serve to explicitly provide the ad-
dress for the next instruction, allowing the CPU to branch
somewhere else.
