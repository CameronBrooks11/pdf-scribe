e Ina memory mapped microprocessor, all the peripherals
occupy the same memory space as the data (and the instruc-
tions, in a von Neumann architecture).

The ARMÂ®Cortex-A9 microprocessor uses memory mapping. A
major advantage of memory mapped devices is in simplicity: read-
ing from an input device (a bank of switches, for example, or some-
thing more complicated) or writing to an output device (a set of
LEDs, for example, or something more complicated) is done exactly
the same way, and with exactly the same opcodes, as reading from
or writing to memory.
