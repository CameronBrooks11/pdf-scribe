Program Execution & Pipelining

To expand on the concepts discussed above, we can elaborate on
the CPU execution cycle. As previously mentioned, a CPU contains
several registers for manipulating data.

Definition: The program counter (pc) is a special register that holds the
address in memory of the next instruction in the program
currently running.

When the CPU is powered on, pc is initialized in hardware to some
default (often 0x0000 0000). The CPU then cycles through the
following steps:
1. Fetches the instruction stored in the memory address held in
pe.
2. Decodes the instruction.
3. Executes the instruction.
Each of these steps is conducted by special-purpose hardware in
the CPU, and is largely transparent to the programmer (and cer-
tainly transparent to the user). This hardware is fully utilized by
pipelining these steps.
e The CPU is a synchronous sequential circuit, so each of the
above steps takes a clock cycle.

e However the CPU can operate faster than one complete in-
struction for every four clock cycles.

e Each of these steps uses separate hardware, so they can all be
queued.
