Memory Mapping

To explain memory mapping in detail, it is best to present a simple
example. Consider a von Neumann memory mapped system with
4K of memory space. Since 4K = 2? x 2!°, this system must have
an address bus with 12 lines. In hex, these are the addresses from
0x000 to OxFFF. In this address space we have a 2K x 8 RAM chip
and a 2K x 8 ROM chip

e Since 2K + 2K = 4K, these two chips completely fill the
memory space available.

 

e However it is completely up to us which specific 2 K memory

 

 

 

 

addresses are assigned to the ROM chip (and the remaining ROM | OxFFF
go to the RAM chip).
OxA00 ---->
e Unless you are a sociopath, you will also recognize that the 0x800
only practical option is to assign a contiguous block of ad- RAM | 0x7FF
dresses to each chip.
0x200 ----+|
As an arbitrary design choice, we will put the RAM chip at the “bot- 0x000
tom” of the memory space, using addresses 0x000 to 0x7FF. The at |

ROM chip will then go at the “top” of the memory space, using
addresses 0x800 to 0xFFF. This is shown schematically in Figure 8.
Typically memory maps are drawn vertically this way, with the Figure 8: Memory map used in the example.
lowest address at the bottom and the highest address on the top.

However, I reserve the right to draw memory maps sideways, es-

pecially when the memory maps with very large address space is

large.
