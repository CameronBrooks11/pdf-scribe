Types of Memory

Memory is subdivided into two basic types: random-access mem-
ory (RAM) and read-only memory (ROM). The name “random-
access” is a bit archaic, since all modern memory is random-access.
This is in contrast to extremely obsolete storage technologies like
relays, mechanical counters, or delay lines, which can only be se-
quentially accessed.

e We can both read from (i.e., non-destructively access) and write
to RAM. Both of these processes are “fast” in microcontroller
terms (i.e. nanoseconds or less).

e RAM is usually volatile, which means it needs an active
power source to preserve data. It is possible to make non-
volatile RAM (often using battery back-ups) but these are
expensive and only used in certain specialist applications.

There are also two common subtypes of RAM: dynamic and static
RAM (DRAM and SRAM, respectively).

e InDRAM, data is usually retained as a stored charge on a ca-
pacitor. Each time the data is read the capacitor loses a bit of
charge, and even when the data is not being read the capaci-
tor will gradually “leak charge”. Consequently, DRAM must
be periodically refreshed to preserve data quality. The major
advantage of DRAM is that it is relatively cheap.

e The RAM listed in the specs for your laptop /tablet/phone/s-
mart watch/poptart is a type of DRAM.

e inSRAM, data is usually retained in a flip flop. These always
