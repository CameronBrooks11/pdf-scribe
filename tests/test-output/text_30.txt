be enabled. This is the chip select logic. Designing a combina-
tional circuit to select all addresses belonging to that chip is equiva-
lent to finding the logical expression for when the (n—m)-input
AND evaluates as true for the (n — m) highest order bits that
identify that memory chip.

e Alternatively, designing a combinational circuit to select all
addresses belonging to that chip is equivalent to designing a
decoder to detect a particular (n — m)-bit number.

The connections to the RAM and ROM chips, and the chip select
logic, is shown in Figure 9. Note that as only one chip can be en-
abled at a given time, there is no need to use tri-state drivers or any
other circuitry at the address and data ports. As discussed above,
and shown in Figure 1, the tri-state driver and other circuitry is
contained inside each memory chip, at the level of each memory
cell.

Note that it is not necessary for all memory chips to be the same
size. The same address lines that are passed internally to larger-

sized memory chips can also be used as the chip select logic for

smaller-sized memory chips without any issues.
