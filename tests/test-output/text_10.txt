e Ifa 32-bit architecture uses a 16-bit instruction set, ° then two
instructions can be fetched at once and held for sequential
execution.

This is shown schematically in Figure 2. Note that pc must also
be incremented — this is not shown explicitly but it should occur
basically simultaneously with the fetch step.

 

5 An ARM processor can be configured to
operating in “thumb mode”, which uses 16-
bit instructions — but we won't do that in this
course.

In reality program execution can be more complicated than the
simple pipeline schematic shown in Figure 2: consider what might
need to happen if the execution step for instruction 2 directs the
program to conditionally branch to another part of the program.
Fortunately, in this class, you just need a conceptual appreciation
for the basics of CPU operation.
