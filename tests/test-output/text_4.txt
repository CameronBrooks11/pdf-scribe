the same address. If you want to access a byte of memory, you
have to read the entire word-sized block and then extract the
particular 8 bits of interest from a register in the CPU.

The data is referred to as a number, but in this context what is a
number? Fundamentally, computers understand three different
kinds of numbers. These are closely related to the signals discussed
in the previous lesson with regards to the various buses in a micro-
processor.

Definition: Data is a number stored in memory that represents some
form of information used in computation. Data is the type of
number that is of primary interest to the systemâ€™s users.

Definition: Memory can also store the address of other memory cells.
When this is implemented in high-level computer languages,
it is called a pointer. Remember, addresses are also numbers.

Definition: Finally, memory can store instructions for the CPU. These are
numbers that index a pre-defined table of operations. These
are often referred to as opcodes.

It is important to recognize that the only way the CPU can tell
the difference between data, addresses, and opcodes is by con-
text. High-level programming languages typically provide a lot
of protection against accidentally mixing these types of numbers,
low-level programming languages provide less protection.

e At the lowest level, it is perfectly possible to take two data
values and add them together, then treat the result as an ad-
dress, look up the number stored at that address, add it to the
address number, then execute that result as an opcode.
