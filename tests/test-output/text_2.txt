address is a number that serves as the unique identifier for a single
memory cell. The memory chip or circuitry decodes the address
to identify the memory cell and either read or write to that cell as
requested. The actual address decoding process uses a minterm.

e Every memory cell is connected to the n bit address bus
through an n-input AND gate.

e A unique combination of lines or their complements from the
address bus are used for each AND gate, such that for a given
address on the bus only one AND gate will be high at a time.

This is shown schematically in Figure 1.
To be useful, memory should support two operations:

Definition: Load (sometimes called read) refers to the CPU retrieving
data from memory and storing it in one (or more) of the
registers inside the CPU. In this case, the CPU provides the
address and the memory provides the number from the ap-
propriate memory cell.

Definition: Store (sometimes called write) refers to the CPU putting data
into memory. In this case the CPU provides both the address
and the number to be placed in the appropriate memory cell.

it should be clear, from the description of these operations, that the
data bus has to accommodate information travelling into and out of
the CPU.

e The address bus only has to operate in “one direction”: infor-
mation passes from the CPU to memory. It should be clear

minterms to load data. For simplicity, there is
only a 3-bit memory space — obviously this is
too small to be practical.
