Chip Select Logic

To continue the above example, as each of these memory chips has
2K of memory cells, they need 11 input lines for the address bus,
and both will have an 8 input/output lines for the data bus. What
happens if we try to retrieve the number stored at address 0xA00?

e The address 0xA00 in binary is 0b1010 0000 0000.

e However, as each memory chip accepts only the 11 lowest-
order lines from the address bus, both memory chips will
recieve a signal of 0b010 0000 0000, which means that the
RAM chip will try to return the number at 0x200 as well.

e We can’t have two numbers on the data bus at the same time!

It is a problem if both memory chips try to “talk” at the same time,
since there is only one shared data bus.

e The solution is to use the remaining high-order address bit as
a chip select (CS) to specify which memory chip to enable.

The RAM chip accepts addresses from 0x000 to 0x7FF, giving us the
a range in binary of:
Address bit Qa11 Qji9 Ag Ag a7 ag a5 A, AZ Ag A, Ag

Lowest 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
Highest O 1 2 2 21 212122 121éd%41é6%421

 

 

Equivalent O ¥% xX x x x xX X X xX x x

As shown above, all possible values of the 11 lowest-order bits must
be accepted by the RAM chip, so we can replace these with “don’t-
