e For example, RAM 1 is uniquely selected when @5@4@13012 =
1.

e However, given the memory map, RAM in general is
selected when @; = 1, and selecting between RAM 1
and RAM 2 can be accomplished using only bit aj2,so a
simplified chip select logic for RAM 1 is @i5@)2 = 1.

The full and simplified chip select logic is given below.

Chip Full Logic Simplified Logic

 

RAM 1 @15@ 4413012 G15 412
RAM 2) @15@ 4413012 G15 412
ROM 1 ay5@y4013 Q15G14
ROM 2 = ay5a1413 415014013
ROM 3 15414413 15414413

Which type of logic should be used? In this course, the full
logic expression should be used.

e The simplified logic is “cheaper” in terms of requiring
fewer logic gates. But... if a boneheaded programmer
tries to read from unmapped memory space, the simpli-
fied logic can happily return a number from the wrong
address.

For example, if the programmer tries to read from ad-
dress 0x2400 = 0b0010 0100 0000 0000, the simplified
chip select logic will activate RAM 1, and return the num-
ber stored at address 0x0400.

e So the simplified logic is “expensive” in terms of the po-
