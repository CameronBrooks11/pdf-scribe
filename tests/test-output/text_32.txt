pretty clear that we will need two chips to store the desired
RAM memory space.

Alternatively, we can convert the size of the RAM chip to hex-
adecimal:

4K = (2?)(2!°) = 2 = (2")(2*)(2) = 0x1000.
Since 2 x 0x1000 = 0x2000 it is also clear by this method that
we need to two chips for the RAM.

e The total address space of RAM (0x0000 to 0x1FFF) needs
to get divided between the two chips. The only sensi-
ble choice is to have one chip take the first half of the
addresses (0x0000 to 0Ox0FFF) and the second take the
second half (0x1000 to 0x1FFF).

For the ROM, we have:
(OxFFFF — 0xA000) + 1 = 0x6000 = 3(2')(2")(2")(2")

= 3x 28 =3 x (2°)(2'°) = 24K.
We therefore need three 8 Kx8 ROM chips to store the desired
ROM memory space.

Again we could also convert the size of the ROM chip to hex-
adecimal:

8K = (23)(2!°) = 2!8 = 2(24)(2")(2") = 0x2000.

Since 3 x 0x2000 = 0x6000 it is also clear by this method that
we need to three chips for the ROM.
