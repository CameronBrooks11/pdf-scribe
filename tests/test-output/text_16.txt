preserve data quality, hence they are called “static”. SRAM is
also faster than DRAM. However each bit of SRAM is physi-
cally larger and more complex, consequently SRAM is signifi-
cantly more expensive.

e The cache size listed in the specs for the processor of your lap-
top/table/phone/smart watch/doorbell is usually a type of
SRAM.

The name “read-only” is a bit archaic, since most modern ROM can,
technically, be rewritten.

e To further complicate matters, ROM is also “random-access”.

e Reading data from ROM is “fast” in microcontroller terms
(i.e., nanoseconds or less), however writing to ROM is typ-
ically “slow” in microcontroller terms (milliseconds or sec-
onds), and sometimes impossible while the microcontroller is
operating — the ROM can only be rewritten with an external
tool use to program the microcontroller.

For our purposes, ROM only stores programs, not data: The set of
instructions telling the CPU what to do are stored in ROM, and the
data telling the CPU what to do it with is stored in RAM. There are
a few different subtypes of ROM that are still relevant.

e Mask-programmable ROM (PROM) can be written to only
once, usually at the factory. After that the programs are essen-
tially hard-coded — no updates are possible!

e Erasable PROM (EPROM) can be erased and rewritten, but
it is an invasive procedure: often the EPROM needs to be re-
