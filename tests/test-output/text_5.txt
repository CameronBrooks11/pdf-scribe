to use a decimal value for an address. We will always use hex or » »

binary for opcodes. It never makes sense to talk about an opcode as
a decimal value. Furthermore, we will typically avoid talking about
opcodes in numeric form whenever possible. Human-readable
assembly language is difficult enough! Data, however, can be dis-
cussed as a hex, binary, or decimal number, depending on what
kind of data it is.

e This distinction is important when writing code for a micro-
controller. For example, the compiler will not accept an ad-
dress written as a decimal number, but often it will accept
(and properly convert) a decimal value stored as data.
