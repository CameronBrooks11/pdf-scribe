e When Select= 0 or Read/Write= 1, the flip-flop is prevented
from seeing a clock edge, so the value of Q remains constant.

The Select input is used to to address a memory unit (usually a
byte, so eight 1-bit RAM cells will have a common Select input).
To achieve this, a k x 2* decoder is used. This converts a given k-
bit address (i.e. a binary number) into one of 2" select inputs. The
RAM block is then 2* x n 1-bit RAM cells, where n is the width of the
memory unit (again, usually n = 8). An example of a RAM block of
memory (with n = 4 instead of n = 8, because Iam too lazy to draw
that many units) is shown in Figure 5.

The RAM block in Figure 5 has a global enable, used to enable the
2 x 4 decoder. This is advantageous because it allows us to easily
combine multiple RAM blocks to achieve more memory. As we will
discuss in more detail when we describe memory mapping, we can
create a second layer of addresses (with an additional decoder) to
use to active at a specific memory block; and as only one memory
block is active at a time, each of these blocks can have the same
internal addresses.

It is worthwhile studying Figure 5 to understand how (and where)
data is written to (or read from) for various combinations of inputs,
control signals, and addresses.
