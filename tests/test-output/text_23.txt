Philosophy of Memory Spaces

Memory is classified by the number of bits of storage, and by how
these bits are organized. Typically a memory chip is described by
the mnemonic NU xn, where N and n are integers, and U is one of
the prefixes for memory sizes (typically kK, M, or G).

e The first part, NU, describes the number of addresses on the
chip.

e The second part, n, describes the width of each address in
bits.

Therefore, knowing your system has 64 Kb of RAM is fine for im-
pressing your friends, but as microcontroller engineers it is more
useful to know if the RAM is organized as 8 K x 8 (8 K memory cells,
each 8 bits wide) or 4K x 16 (4K memory cells, each 16 bits wide).

Memory organization can further be broken down by the number
of address spaces available.

e In Harvard architecture there are separate address spaces
(i.e., different address buses) for program storage (typically
on ROM, as discussed above) and data storage (typically on
RAM, as discussed above).

e Ina von Neumann architecture the same address space is
used for program and data storage.

Many microprocessors have von Neumann architecture. ”

Figure 7: Equal amounts of memory for pro-
gram storage (“code”) and data storage
(“data”): Harvard architecture on the left,

von Neumann architecture on the right. The
Harvard architecture requires fewer addresses,
but twice as many buses.

7 In previous iterations of this course I claimed
that the ARM®Cortex-A9 used in this course
was von Neumann. However upon reading the
technical specifications it is actually
modified-Harvard architecture, in which
instructions and data can be fetched
simultaneously, but program code can be moved
through memory the same as data — so it is
kind of a hybrid of both.
