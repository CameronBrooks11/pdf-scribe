decoder outputs to OR gates. Less permanent solutions include con-
necting decoder outputs to OR gates using fuses or relay switches,
allowing the memory to be rewritten. Perhaps you may also see

a parallel between the address/output grid in Figure 6 and the
punch card used in the very early days of computers. In essence,
these ROM blocks are really just tables of data: addresses are rows,
outputs are columns, and the value in each cell is a 1 if there is a
connecting dot, and 0 otherwise.

Figure 6: Circuit diagram of a 2" x n block of
ROM memory, where k = 2 and n = 4. This
memory block is abstract — the open circles on
the busses for outputs O03, Oz, and Oj indicate
that connections may or may not be present.
The connections on the bus for O; are shown
explicitly, and in the expanded view on the right
the individual wires in the bus are shown.
