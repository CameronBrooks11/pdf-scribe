from the memory circuit in Figure 1 that nothing in memory
is capable of putting information onto the address bus.

The memory circuit in Figure 1 only allows the load operation,
so it is not a circuit with full functionality. !

To allow the CPU to store to memory, the circuit in Figure 1
should provide a second set of tri-state drivers pointing from
the data bus into the memory, and additional combinational
logic to ensure that when a memory cell is selected, either
only one of the two tri-state drivers are active, or there is an
additional control on the memory cell itself to select whether
data is being written or read.

Some sort of global “memory enable” bit may also be neces-
sary if the data bus is used for other purposes — the address
line will always have a valid address (as (000). is a valid ad-
dress) regardless of whether or not the CPU wants to do any-
thing with the memory.

Furthermore, note that there is not necessarily any correlation be-
tween the size of the address bus (the laughably small, but easy
to draw, value of 3 is used in Figure 1) and the size of the data bus
(just referenced as n in Figure 1).

e Most microcontrollers have byte addressable memory, where
the memory cell (and consequently the data bus) are eight
bits wide.

e Some microcontrollers have word addressable memory, where
either memory cells are larger than a byte, or (more com-
monly) multiple byte-sized memory cells are grouped under
